    <h1>Privacy Policy for Coin App</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last updated: January 16, 2026</p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Welcome to Coin App ("we," "our," or "us"). This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information 
        when you use our mobile application that detects and identifies Euro coins using AI-powered computer 
        vision technology.
    </p>
    <p>
        We are committed to protecting your privacy. This app is designed with privacy in mind and processes 
        all data locally on your device.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>
        Coin App processes data locally on your device and does not collect or transmit personal information 
        to external servers. The app may access:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Camera Access:</strong> The app requires camera access to capture images of coins for 
        real-time detection and identification.</li>
        <li><strong>Photo Library Access:</strong> If you choose to analyze existing images, the app may 
        request access to your device's photo library.</li>
        <li><strong>Local Storage:</strong> The app may temporarily store images and AI model files on your 
        device for processing purposes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>All data processing occurs locally on your device. Specifically:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Coin Detection:</strong> Images captured or selected are processed by the on-device AI 
        model to detect and identify Euro coins.</li>
        <li><strong>Model Files:</strong> AI model files are downloaded and stored locally to enable offline 
        functionality.</li>
        <li><strong>No Cloud Processing:</strong> Images and detection results are not sent to any remote 
        servers or cloud services.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>All image processing happens locally on your device</li>
        <li>Images are not permanently stored unless you explicitly save them</li>
        <li>AI model files are stored in your device's application directory</li>
        <li>No user data is transmitted to external servers</li>
        <li>The app does not create user accounts or collect identifying information</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
        Coin App uses the following third-party components:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Ultralytics YOLO:</strong> An open-source AI framework for object detection that runs 
        entirely on-device. No data is sent to Ultralytics servers during normal app operation.</li>
        <li><strong>Flutter Framework:</strong> The app is built using Flutter, Google's UI toolkit. Flutter 
        itself does not collect user data from this app.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The app may download AI model files from public repositories during initial setup or updates. 
        This connection is only made to retrieve the model files and does not transmit any personal data.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Permissions</h2>
    <p>The app requests the following permissions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Camera:</strong> Required to capture images of coins for detection</li>
        <li><strong>Storage/Photos:</strong> Optional permission to load images from your device for analysis</li>
        <li><strong>Internet:</strong> Used only to download AI model files during setup; not used for data 
        transmission</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can revoke these permissions at any time through your device settings.</p>

    <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>
        Our app does not knowingly collect any personal information from children. The app is suitable for 
        all ages and processes all data locally on the device without any data collection.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>
        Since the app does not collect or transmit personal data, there is no data retention policy. Any 
        images processed by the app remain on your device under your control. Temporary data used during 
        processing is automatically cleared when you close the app or can be manually cleared by uninstalling 
        the app.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>Since we do not collect personal data, there is no data to access, modify, or delete from our servers. 
    You have complete control over any data on your device:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Clear app data through your device settings</li>
        <li>Uninstall the app to remove all associated files</li>
        <li>Revoke permissions at any time</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>10. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting 
        the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last updated" date. You are advised to review 
        this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
    </p>

    <h2>11. Analytics and Tracking</h2>
    <p>
        This app does not use any analytics, tracking, or advertising services. We do not collect usage 
        statistics, crash reports, or any other telemetry data.
    </p>

    <h2>12. International Users</h2>
    <p>
        Since all processing occurs locally on your device, there are no international data transfers. 
        The app complies with GDPR, CCPA, and other privacy regulations by design, as it does not collect 
        or process personal data on external servers.
    </p>
